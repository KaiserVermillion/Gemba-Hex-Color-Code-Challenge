In CSS, we can represent RGB colour values using hexadecimal, from #000000 for
white, to #FFFFFF for black. If we’re being particularly silly, we can use values that are
also English words, e.g.

● #C0FFEE (coffee)
● #57471C (static)
● #DABBED (dabbed)
● #F00 (foo)
The challenge is to determine all hexadecimal colour values that are also english
words. You may find the following word list useful.
We’re looking for a clean, readable solution in a programming language of your
choice. We'll look at your code (and project, generally) to get an idea of what to
expect if you were working with us. This should affect your style. For us, the quality
and structure of your code is at least as important as being able to solve the
problem.
Please submit your solution by email in the form of a link to a hosted Git repository
or as an attached archive. We should be able to clone the repository ourselves and
run it, so please include any necessary instructions / documentation on how to do
so.
There are a few ways to approach the problem, and that’s what we’re most interested
in! There’s no correct number of words we are looking for as such, as it will depend
on the assumptions you have made.
Good luck!
